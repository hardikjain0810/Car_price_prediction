<h1>🎯 Travel Package Purchase Prediction using Machine Learning</h1><br>
<h3>📌 Project Overview</h3>

This project aims to predict whether a customer will purchase a travel package based on their demographic and behavioral information. The goal is to help businesses identify potential customers and design targeted marketing strategies using Machine Learning.

The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison of multiple classification algorithms.

<h3>🧠 Problem Statement</h3>
Travel companies often struggle to identify customers who are most likely to purchase a travel package. By analyzing customer data, we can build a predictive model that classifies whether a customer will purchase or not purchase a travel package.

<h3>🔧 Technologies & Tools Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Programming Language: Python</li>
  <li>Libraries:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Pandas</li>
    <li>NumPy</li>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
    <li>Seaborn</li>
    <li>Scikit-learn</li>
  </ul>
  <li>IDE: Jupyter Notebook</li>
</ul>


<h3>📊 Results</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Machine Learning models successfully predicted customer purchase behavior</li>
  <li>Ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost performed better than baseline models</li>
  <li>Feature engineering and handling class imbalance significantly improved model performance</li>
</ul>

<h3>📌 Future Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI</li>
<li>Add a user interface for predictions</li>

<li>Perform hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy</li>
