<h1>🎯 Travel Package Purchase Prediction using Machine Learning</h1><br>
<h4>📌 Project Overview</h4>

This project aims to predict whether a customer will purchase a travel package based on their demographic and behavioral information. The goal is to help businesses identify potential customers and design targeted marketing strategies using Machine Learning.

The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison of multiple classification algorithms.

<h4>🧠 Problem Statement</h4>
Travel companies often struggle to identify customers who are most likely to purchase a travel package. By analyzing customer data, we can build a predictive model that classifies whether a customer will purchase or not purchase a travel package.
